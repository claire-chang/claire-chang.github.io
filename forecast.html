                <h3>A challenge to migrate one product to another</h3>
                <p>
                Our leadership decided to migrate Yield Analytics into our core product, Monetize. 
                This wasn’t just a technical move: Yield Analytics was generating over $3M in annual revenue, 
                and any disruption risked client churn. At the same time, its workflows were outdated—key forecasting 
                functions were scattered across disconnected pages, forcing publishers to jump between products for yield 
                management, campaign planning, and troubleshooting. This created a clear design opportunity: preserve 
                critical revenue features while modernizing the workflow to improve efficiency and retention.

                <h5>Research</h5>
                <h3>Redefining the experience, not just migrating it</h3>
                <p>I led research to understand how publishers actually used Yield Analytics. Key insights included:</p>
                <br/>
                <ul>
                <li>Core features were spread across pages with no workflow connection, creating inefficiency.</li>
                <li>There was little existing knowledge of how users transitioned between Yield Analytics and Monetize.</li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <p>To close these gaps, I interviewed internal experts and mapped the end-to-end user journey.</p>

                </div>
                <p>
                To complement this, I created a “Publisher Ad Agent” with Copilot Studio, anticipating 
                common publisher questions and helping the team ground our design decisions in real user needs.
                </p>

                <h3>Prioritizing features strategically</h3>
                <p>
                Using the mapped user journeys, I identified where Yield Analytics features naturally aligned 
                with Monetize workflows. I created wireframes to visualize how those functions could be embedded 
                into existing flows.
                </p>
                <p>
                Through discussions with PMs and engineers, I facilitated alignment on which features to tackle first. 
                We chose forecast builder because it had the highest user demand, delivered foundational business value, 
                and was technically achievable in the near term. 
                </p>

        <!-- Solution -->

                <h5>Solution</h5>
                <h3>An experience that connects workflows</h3>
                <p>
                I led multiple rounds of design iteration, testing, and alignment with stakeholders to refine 
                the forecast builder experience. The solution preserved critical forecasting functionality while 
                addressing key pain points: publishers can now continue directly into next-step actions from the same 
                page, eliminating unnecessary context switching and saving significant task time.
                </p>
                <p>
                Beyond the immediate solution, I created vision artifacts mapping where Yield Analytics features would 
                live within Monetize. This helped leadership balance near-term delivery with a long-term roadmap.
